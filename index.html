In the case of the later you may want to see you self to the "go back" button as this website merely showcases some of my work and a how to contact me, though you are welcome to stay and explore!

                    My name is Nick Brown. I am currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am an avid outdoorsman and can often be found on a bike, paddleboard, or mountainside exploreing the outdoors. When I am not spending time outside I am inside most likely reading, writing, or editing code. Around a year ago I found myself looking for a new challenge in life and was met by the complex world of code. Since then I have spent my time absorbing as much information as possible from every source I can find.

                <p>
                    My technical coding skills include experience in: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and soon to be many more languages. As for my other professional skills, I have spent the majority of my professional career at the retail cooperative REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.). In that time, I worked my way up from customer service, to sales, then into the shop as a tech level 1, then onto the dock working in order fulfillment, and finally as the operations sales lead. While working as an operations lead, I helped oversee shipping and receiving and inventory management. As a team leader at the store it was my job to help guide employees working under the operations umbrella in addition to running our semi-annual store inventory periods and large used gear sales.
