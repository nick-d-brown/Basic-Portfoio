                    lost internet traveler. In the case of the later you may want to see you self to the "go back" button
                    as this website merely showcases some of my work and a how to contact me, though you are welcome to stay
                    and explore! In the case of the former, welcome to my portfolio website.

                    My name is Nick Brown. I am currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am an avid outdoorsman and can often be found on
                    a bike, paddleboard, or mountainside exploreing the outdoors. When I am not spending time outside I am
                    inside most likely reading, writing, or editing code. Around a year ago I found myself looking for a
                    new challenge in life and was met by the complex world of code. Since then I have spent my time absorbing
                    as much information as possible from every source I can find.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical coding skills include experience in: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and soon to be many more languages. As for my
                    other professional skills, I have spent the majority of my professional career at the retail cooperative
                    REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.). In that time, I worked my way up from customer service, to sales,
                    then into the shop as a tech level 1, then onto the dock working in order fulfillment, and finally as
                    the operations sales lead. While working as an operations lead, I helped oversee shipping and receiving
                    and inventory management. As a team leader at the store it was my job to help guide employees working
                    under the operations umbrella in addition to running our semi-annual store inventory periods and large
                    used gear sales.
